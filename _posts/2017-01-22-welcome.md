I'm currently auditing a master's level algorithms class at Northeastern University and reading through the textbook, [Introduction to Algorithms](http://tinyurl.com/jtm87qo) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. You can find a copy of the textbook for free online.

As part of my study process I'm planning to implement each algorithm that we study in Ruby code, benchmark it, and write up a blog posts to defining the algorithm while explaining how to calculate the Worst Case runtime, what the use cases are and any other relevant thoughts.

### Why Ruby?

You would be better of using the standard libraries rather than trying to implement these algorithms on your own in ruby.  However, I'm thinking of this as a useful learning exercise, rather than a practical library. I plan to discuss where some of these algorithms are implemented already in the Ruby source code and standard libraries(or even non-standard). I'm doing this as a way to actively engage with the book and learn its content on a deeper level. Hopefully, this can also act as a guide for other Rubyists learning algorithms.
