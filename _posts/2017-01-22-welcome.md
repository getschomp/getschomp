I'm currently auditing a master's level algorithms class at Northeastern University and reading through the textbook, [Introduction to Algorithms](http://tinyurl.com/jtm87qo) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. You can find a copy of the textbook for free online.

As part of my study process I'm planning to implement each algorithm that we study in Ruby code, benchmark it, and write up a blog posts to defining the algorithm while explaining how to calculate the Worst Case runtime, what the use cases are and any other relevant thoughts.

### Why Ruby?

Although these algorithms would probably run faster in some other language and may even be implemented in C under the hood in Ruby, I think this will be a useful learning exercise. I also plan to discuss where some of these algorithms are be implemented in the Ruby source code. I'm doing this as a way to actively engage with the book and learn its content on a deeper level. Hopefully, this can also act as a guide for other Rubyists learning algorithms.
