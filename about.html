## About


I'm a software developer with a somewhat non-traditional background. My formal higher education is in physical architectural design rather than software architectural design.

I've always had a passion for making things and one of the ways I expressed that as a young child, in the 90's, was working on a tiny DIY skateboarding website as well as a small command line RPG game.

Later I went on to work on websites at a few of the companies I interned at. I started studying code more seriously in my spare time in the 2012 and decided to attend a programming bootcamp in 2014. Right now I'm working with React, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, backed by Postgres, Redshift, Readis and other NoSQL databases.  I'm also working on a side project that uses neo4j to analyze Public Transit Nodes in a graph database.

I love that with code a person can make something  beautiful and useful with few resources.
